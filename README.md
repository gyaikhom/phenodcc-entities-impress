# IMPReSS Entities

This project implements entities maintained by the
[IMPReSS system](http://www.mousephenotype.org/impress). IMPReSS
stands for _International Mouse Phenotyping Resource of Standardised Screens_,
which is the principle reference that links all of the systems developed by the
IMPC. It defines experimental procedures and which results from each of these
experiments should be record. It also defines the collection and temporal
ordering of procedures. The information recorded in the `impress`
database is used by all of the software modules at the PhenoDCC.

_The database schema is defined elsewhere in the IMPReSS system_. In this
project we only define entities that are used by
[Phenoview](https://www.mousephenotype.org/phenoview) and the
[QC tool](https://www.mousephenotype.org/qc).
